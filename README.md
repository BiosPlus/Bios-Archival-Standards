# Bios-Archival-Standards
A collection of gists and notes to help me standardize my archival efforts across the board, absolutely anyone is allowed to take any part of this and restructure it to their liking.

# Notes (coding style/general usage/etc):
- Not all code has to have a million variables when a straight line will do the job just fine.
- It's expected that any tools or executables being used as part of a script are accessible via your PATH variable.
- Unless the site you're ripping from has the infrastructure to spare for your ripping, you should generally apply a form of client-side rate limiting in an effort to not hinder the access for other users.
