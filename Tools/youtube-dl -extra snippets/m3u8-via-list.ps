# Snippet for ripping a list of m3u8 streams via youtube dl.
# This presumes that you have a list of stream links in a txt file.
# Since m3u8 streams don't ordinarily carry enough metadata to title output videos individually, this snippet will parse the amount of lines in the list, create a folder for each and then throw the corresponding mkv into it's folder.
# Youtube-dl is used instead of ffmpeg as it supports resumption in the event of lost connections.


$lister = "c:\rip\list.txt"
$urllist = Get-Content $lister

#echo $urllist

Foreach ($ffurl in $urllist) {
    echo "Now processing: $foldernumber"
    mkdir $foldernumber
    youtube-dl "$ffurl" -o "$foldernumber\$foldernumber.mkv"
    $foldernumber++
    echo "episode complete"
